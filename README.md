# Fortnite Festival Stage AFK XP

Earning BP XP in Fortnite is a pain, this is a script that assists in making it easier for people - for those that don't have time to grind. This automates the process of Jam stage by randomly changing songs and instruments at a 60 second interval. This also allows you to complete the daily "Play x instrument for 5 minutes" festival quest.

## Pre-Requirements
Once the files have been installed, open a terminal within the directory and run the following command to install the pre-required packages.
```bash
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```

## Usage/Examples
Once the required packages are installed and you're festival stage, you can run the script in your terminal and click on the game to begin the process.

```bash
python main.py
```


## FAQ

#### How long will the script run for?

The script runs indefinitely, so once you're finished you will have to manually stop the script.

#### Is there any other XP methods you've made?

Yes, I've made a more in-depth macro for Lego Fortnite which has a similar cap, allowing you to spend 3.5 hours in the game to earn XP.
